     ARC app_main.html.  This file is used as the background page for ARC apps.
     It only embeds an iframe for ARC's main.  This is so we do not have to
     specify a background page in the manifest.json that looks like
     '_modules/arcruntimeid/main.html', because the extension validator
     in Chrome does not understand _modules relative paths.  Rather than bake
     this knowledge and complexity into the validator, it is better to use this
     App relative app_main.html.  -->
